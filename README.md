# BFS-Search-Torch-Quizz

## Story
Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. 
They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. 
Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. 
When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, 
can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?

## Breadth-first Search
Breadth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root, 
and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
 
 **This algorithm does not find the best solution!**
